## Project Details

### Overview
SwasthyaAI, an AI-powered health platform that analyses symptoms and provides personalised AYUSH-based remedies, lifestyle suggestions, and medical guidance to promote natural and healthy living.
### Problem Statement
Many people rely excessively on pharmaceuticals, neglecting traditional and holistic healing methods. This over-dependence weakens the body's natural functions and leads to long-term medication use, especially among the elderly. There is a lack of AI-powered healthcare systems that integrate traditional medicine (AYUSH) with modern diagnostics to provide personalized, natural remedies while ensuring timely medical intervention. Our solution aims to bridge this gap by leveraging AI to recommend holistic treatments, promote preventive care, and align with SDG Goal 3: Good Health & Well-being.
### Solution
SwasthyaAI analyzes symptoms, refines diagnoses through user inputs, and suggests natural remedies, diet, and lifestyle changes for mild conditions. It recommends medical consultation for severe cases, identifying the right specialist. With real-time location services, users can find nearby doctors, clinics, and pharmacies. A personalized health profile stores medical history, allergies, and conditions, providing tailored health advice.

## Additional Resources

### **Project Timeline**  
1. **Design:** Plan features and create a user-friendly UI/UX design in Figma.  
2. **Development:** Start building the frontend and backend.  
3. **Testing:** Use Postman and other tools to test API functionality.  
4. **Microservices:** Develop independent services for email notifications, Google Maps integration, profile management, and database handling.  
5. **Integration:** Connect the frontend with the backend for a seamless user experience.  
6. **Research & Dataset:** Develop a method to create an AYUSH-based dataset for natural remedies and health recommendations.  

### **Challenges Faced**  
1. **Email Service:** Unable to verify our SendGrid account, which blocked email integration.  
2. **LLM Limitations:** Couldn’t download the required Medical LLM for fine-tuning due to limited resources.  
3. **NLP Challenges:** Faced time constraints in developing an NLP model for dataset creation.

### **Future Enhancements**  

- **Mobile App:** Develop a mobile application for better accessibility and daily health notifications.  
- **Custom AI Model:** Instead of relying on expensive general-purpose models, we plan to build an LLM specifically designed for our platform.  
- **Personalized Health Insights:** Improve personalization by continuously learning from users’ health history, lifestyle, and feedback to provide better recommendations.  
- **Wearable Integration:** Connect with smart devices to enable real-time health tracking and early risk detection.
